## EPL-Dissector with XDD support plugin for Wireshark

Parses XDD files and uses extracted information to correctly label SDOs and PDOs. Depends on libxml2.

#### Don't clone this

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/epl-viz/wireshark

instead. Build files for plugins expect to be ran out the wireshark source tree.

### Installation

As the stock EPL dissector is already linked when the plugin DLL is loaded, one needs to manually disable it (`Analyze ‚ùØ Enabled Protocols`). When using libwireshark, one could call `proto_disable_proto_by_name("epl")` before commencing dissection. To keep the dissectors apart, this one is called EPL+XDD with `epl-xdd` as Wireshark protocol abbreviation.

### License

The base dissector and any modification are licensed under the GNU GPL2.0+.
